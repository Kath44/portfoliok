            <p>Hi! I’m Mary Kathleen Repunte, but you can call me Kath. I’m a 20-year-old third-year BSIT student at St. Cecilia’s College. I love diving into a good story while listening to music—it’s my go-to way to relax and rejuvenate my mind. It helps me escape into different worlds and sparks my creativity.As the oldest of five siblings, with two sisters and two brothers, I’ve learned the value of teamwork, responsibility, and patience. These skills have been incredibly useful in both my personal and academic life.I’m passionate about technology and eager to learn and grow in my journey. I’m excited to explore the endless possibilities in the IT field and look forward to the challenges and opportunities ahead.I believe in the power of collaboration and creativity, and I’m eager to connect with others to create something wonderful together. Whether it’s a new project, a tech challenge, or just sharing ideas, I’m always up for it!</p>
